    <p>My name is Pierce Keane. I live in Bellmore, NY. I am currently employed at Memorial Sloan Cancer Center. I am also attending Columbia University's Engineering Boot Camp, working towards a certification in Full Stack Web Development.
    I am actively seeking a new opportunity as a front end, back end, or a full stack developer. Though, I am passionate about the healthcare industry I am open to opportunity's outside of the healthcare field. My hobbies outside of work include working out, hanging with friends, hanging out with my dog named Prince.
